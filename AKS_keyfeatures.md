## ðŸš€ Key Features of Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

### âœ… 1. **Managed Kubernetes Control Plane**
- Azure handles the master nodes, upgrades, and patching
- You manage only the worker nodes (agent pool)

### âœ… 2. **Integrated CI/CD and DevOps**
- Seamless integration with **Azure DevOps**, **GitHub Actions**, and **Terraform**
- Supports automated deployments and rolling updates

### âœ… 3. **Autoscaling**
- Automatically scales pods and nodes based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics
- Supports **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler** and **Cluster Autoscaler**

### âœ… 4. **Multi-AZ and High Availability**
- Deploy across **Availability Zones** for fault tolerance
- Supports **multi-node pools** for workload isolation

### âœ… 5. **Built-in Monitoring and Logging**
- Integrated with **Azure Monitor**, **Log Analytics**, and **Container Insights**
- Real-time metrics, logs, and alerts

### âœ… 6. **Security and RBAC**
- Supports **Azure Active Directory (AAD)** integration
- Fine-grained access control with **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- Network policies and **Pod Security Standards**

### âœ… 7. **Private Cluster and VNet Integration**
- Deploy AKS in a **private VNet**
- Restrict API server access with **private endpoints**

### âœ… 8. **GPU and Windows Node Support**
- Run **GPU workloads** for ML/AI
- Deploy **Windows containers** alongside Linux

### âœ… 9. **Built-in Ingress and Load Balancing**
- Use **NGINX**, **Application Gateway**, or **Azure Front Door**
- Supports TLS termination and path-based routing

### âœ… 10. **Cost Optimization**
- Use **spot nodes** for non-critical workloads
- Scale down during off-peak hours
- Pay only for agent nodes â€” control plane is free
